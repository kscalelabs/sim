## Adding new robot
Adding new embodiment is very straightforward:
1. Create a folder with a new robot [here](https://github.com/kscalelabs/sim/tree/master/sim).
2. Add joint.py file setting up basic properties and join configuration - see an [example](https://github.com/kscalelabs/sim/blob/master/sim/stompy/joints.py).
3. Add the new embodiment configuration and environment [here](https://github.com/kscalelabs/sim/tree/master/sim/humanoid_gym/envs).
4. Add the new embodiment to the [registry](https://github.com/kscalelabs/sim/blob/master/sim/humanoid_gym/envs/__init__.py).

We set up the logic so that your new robot should start to walk with basic configuration.

## Lint and formatting
When you submit the PR we automatically run some checks using black, ruff and mypy.
You can check the logic [here](https://github.com/kscalelabs/sim/blob/master/pyproject.toml).
You can locally run commands below to test the formatting:
```
make format
make static-checks
```
